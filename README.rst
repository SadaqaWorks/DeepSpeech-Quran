DeepSpeech is an open source Speech-To-Text engine, using a model trained by machine learning techniques based on `Baidu's Deep Speech research paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567>`_. Project DeepSpeech uses Google's `TensorFlow <https://www.tensorflow.org/>`_ to make the implementation easier.

Documentation for installation, usage, and training models is available on `deepspeech.readthedocs.io <http://deepspeech.readthedocs.io/?badge=latest>`_.

For the Quran Workflow, dataset and model release, see the folder `data/quran <https://github.com/tarekeldeeb/DeepSpeech-Quran/tree/master/data/quran>`_
